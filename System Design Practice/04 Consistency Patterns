With multiple copies of same data, we are faced with options on how to sync them
this is so clients have consistent view of the data

Consistency (CAP): every read receives the most recent write or an error

Weak Consistency
    after a write, reads may or may not see it, best effort approach is taken
    seen in systems such as memcached
    works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, multiplayer games
    ex: on a phone call and lose reception, regain connection, you don't hear everything spoken during connection loss

Eventual Consistency
    after a write, reads will eventually see it (typically in ms)
    data is replicated asynchronously
    seen in systems such as DNS and email
    works well in highly available systems

Strong Consistency
    after a write, reads will see it
    data is replicated synchronously
    approach is seen in file systems and RDBMSes
    works well in systems that need transactions
