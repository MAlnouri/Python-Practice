DNS translates a domain name such as www.example.com to in IP address

DNS i hierarchical with few authoritative servers at top level
your router or ISP provides info about which DNS servers to contact when doing a lookup
lower level DNS servers cache mappings
can also be cached by browser or OS for some time (based on TTL/time to live)

    NS record (name server) - specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain
    MX record (mail exchange) - specifies the mail servers for accepting messages
    A record (address) - points a name to an IP address
    CNAME (canonical) - points a name to another name or CNAME or to an A record
        - example.com points to www.example.com

services like cloudflare and route 53 provide managed DNS services
some DNS services can route traffic thru various methods
    weighted round robin
        prevents traffic from going to servers under maintenance
        balance between varying cluster sizes
        A/B testing
    latency-based
    geolocation-based

Disadvantages: DNS
    accessing DNS server introduces slight delay, although mitigated by caching
    DNS server management could be complex, generally managed by govs, ISPs, and large companies
    DNS services have recently come under DDoS attacks, preventing users from accessing websites such as twitter without knowing twitters IP address(es)
