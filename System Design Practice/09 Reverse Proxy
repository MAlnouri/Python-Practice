reverse proxy is a web server that centralizes internal services and provides unified interfaces to the public
requests from clients are forwarded to a server that can fulfill it before reverse proxy returns the server's response to the client

additional benefits include:
    increased security
    - hide info about backend servers
    - blacklist IPs
    - limit # of connections to client

    increased scalability and flexibility
    - clients only see reverse proxy IP, allows you to scale servers or change their config
    - SSL termination, decrypt incoming requests, encrypt server responses so backend server don't have to perform expensive operations
    - compression, compress server responses
    - caching, return the response for cached requests
    - static content, server static content directly (html/css/js, photos, videos, etc)

Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy
    deploying lb is useful when you have multiple servers
    often lbs route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function
    
    rp can be useful even with just one web server or application server
    solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 rping and lbing

disadvantages: reverse proxy
    rp results in increased complexity
    single rp is single point of failure, having multiple further increases complexity
