CDN is a globally distrubted network of proxy servers
serving content from locations closer to user
generally static files like html/css/js, photos, videos are served from CDN
some CDNs like Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content
site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact

serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in 2 ways:
    users receive content from data centers close to them
    your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills

Push CDNs
    Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server
    you take responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to CDN, rewriting URLs to point to CDN
    you can configure when content expires and when it updates
    content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizes traffic but maximizes storage
    sites with small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't updated often work well with push CDNs
    content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals

Pull CDNs
    Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content
    you leave content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN
    this results in slower request until the content is cached on the CDN
    A time to live (TTL) determines how long content is cached
    pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed
    sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently requested content remaining on the CDN

Disadvantages: CDN
    CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN
    content might be stale if it is updated before TTL expires it
    CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN
