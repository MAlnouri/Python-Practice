SLIs
Service level indicators
these are metrics over time which inform about the health of a service
ex: 95th percentile latency of homepage requests over past 5 minutes < 300ms
simple: quantitative measurements like latency

SLOs
Service level objectives
these are agreed upon bounds for how often the SLIs must be met
ex: 95th percentile homepage SLI will succeed 99.9% over the year
simple: amount of time that an SLI can be out of specification (target)

SLAs
Service level agreements
these are business level agreements which define service availability for a customer
also defines penalties for failing to deliver that availability
ex: service credits if homepage SLI succeeds less than 99.5% over year
note there is buffer between target (SLO) and agreement (SLA) 99.9% -> 99.5%
simple: business agreements with detailed consequences for failing to deliver service
